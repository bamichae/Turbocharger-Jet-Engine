Specs on how to build the combustion chamber for a turbocharger jet engine.

I haven't seen any code online to calculate the specs of a turbocharger jet
engine combustion chamber, so I took the liberty to create it.

The specs are primarily based on a paper titled:
Turbocharger Jet Engine Build and Engineering Analysis by Han Ju Lee,
Nick Strahan, Emily Boyd. (https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/mems500/13/)

Obviously there are limitations to these specs, and you should do additional
research into things like r-value of your turbocharger, inlet/outlet specs, etc.
but this code should get you mostly there.
